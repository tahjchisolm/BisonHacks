Five Howard students; Zoe Carter, Jaya Carter, Tahj Chisolm, James Fisher, and Kyndall Jones, have teamed up to take on the Howard Hackathon 2020. Their goal is to help all those in need of learning how to take care of debt due to student loans. They will do so by creating an app to keep track of loans and how to handle them.
